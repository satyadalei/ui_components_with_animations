# UI Components Practice

This project is a practice ground for various UI components and effects using React, TypeScript, and Vite. Below are some of the features and components implemented:

## Features

### Text Reveal on Scroll
- **Description**: This feature reveals text as the user scrolls down the page. It uses the `framer-motion` library to animate the text appearance based on the scroll position.
- **Implementation**: The `Introduction` component demonstrates this effect by progressively revealing words as the user scrolls.

### Infinite Scroll
- **Description**: Infinite scroll allows content to load dynamically as the user scrolls down the page, providing a seamless browsing experience.
- **Implementation**: The `LogoTicker` component showcases an infinite scrolling effect, where logos continuously scroll across the screen.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Vite**: For fast development and build processes.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations and scroll-based effects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
